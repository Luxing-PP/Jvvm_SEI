- The types `u1`, `u2`, and `u4` represent an unsigned one-, two-, or four-byte quantity
- This chapter presents the `class` file format using pseudo structures（伪结构） written in a C-like structure notation
-  A `constant_pool` index is considered **valid** if it is greater than zero and less than `constant_pool_count`, with the exception for constants of type `long` and `double` noted in [§4.4.5](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.5).
